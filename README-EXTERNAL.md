# Technical Challenge

We want to see code you write. Coding live in front of strangers is stressful, and doesn't mimic how you write code at work. Instead, we're sending you a small code challenge. 

Please try to spend between two and three hours implementing this. This is to protect you; we don't want you to spend days coding only for either one of us to decide later we aren't a good fit for each other. It isn't a hard cutoff. If you really want to spend more time we can't stop you, but don't feel pressure to spend more time.

We use Typescript across the stack and prefer that you do the same for this challenge, as this helps us determine where your training would start.

Just like in real life, you can use the internet to help you remember some syntax or figure out a library. You should not use someone else's solution for the coding challenge or paste the problem definition in to ChatGPT or Cursor or some other AI coding assistant and submit the output as your own. Use good judgement.

The goal is not to finish the assignment. The goal is to see how you approach a problem and answer questions such as "how do you organize your code?" and "what parts of the problem seem most important to solve first?"

## Rubric

We'll evaluate submissions on the following criteria:

1. Does it run? Working code is the best code!
1. Did you communicate clearly in the README and code?
1. Does it implement the features you decided to tackle?
1. Is it easy to understand?

## Instructions For Submission

Please email [tim@highpointgo.com](mailto:tim@highpointgo.com) and [phil@highpointgo.com](mailto:phil@highpointgo.com) a .zip or a link to a source code repository containing your code. Include a `README.md` file with notes on how to run your code, your design thoughts, etc.

Please email us if anything in the instructions is confusing. We've tried to leave space for creativity and problem-solving, but we also don't want you becoming frustrated or stuck.

The challenge details can be found in CHALLENGE.md, good luck!
